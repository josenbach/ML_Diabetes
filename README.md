# Machine Learning Diabetes

## Selected Topic

Diabetes is a leading cause of disability and mortality in the US. One of the ways healthcare providers monitor blood sugar levels in patients is by taking a blood test to measure HbA1c percentage. HbA1c is a measure of glycated haemoglobin, or glucose(sugar) that is in the red blood cells of the body. Red blood cells have a 2-3 month life span, meaning that HbA1c is an indicator of blood glucose levels over 2-3 months. High HbA1c levels mean that the patient has had 2-3 months of high levels of blood sugar, which is correlated with higher instances of Diabetic complications. Using data from over 70,000 hospitalized diabetic patients nationwide, we are utilizing classification methods to predict whether HbA1c levels are within a normal range, or an abnormal (high) range, based on other health-related factors.

## Reason for topic selection

Most of the data are numeric and sufficient enough for the machine learning model to answer our question.

## Description of datasource

We are using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset spans diabetic hospital encounters nationwide between 1999 and 2008 (the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00296/)).

## Question we hope to answer

Using a machine learning classification model, can demographics, diagnoses, medications, and other related indicators be used to predict whether someone admitted to the hospital with diabetes will have a normal or abnormal (high) HbA1c level. 

## Communication protocols

We will meet asynchronously via Slack and Zoom together when needed.

## Notes of columns
- **Readmitted** Days to inpatient readmission. Values: “<30” if the patient was readmitted in less than 30 days, “>30” if the patient was readmitted in more than 30 days, and “No” for no record of readmission
- **Admission Type**: Integer identifier corresponding to 9 distinct values, for example, emergency, urgent,
elective, newborn, and not available 
- **Discharge Disposition** Integer identifier corresponding to 29 distinct values, for example, discharged to
home, expired, and not available
- **admission_source_id**: Integer identifier corresponding to 21 distinct values, for example, physician referral,
emergency room, and transfer from a hospital 
- **time_in_hospital**: Integer number of days between admission and discharge 
## Technologies that will be used:
## Hosting platform
Github will be the code hosting platform.
## Data Reprocessing and Analysis
Pandas will be used to explore, clean, and perform an analysis. 
## Database
SQLAlchemy and SQLite are used for our database in our analysis.
## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn and TensorFlow are the ML libraries we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is using an 70/30 train-test split ratio. The training set will then be fit into a Neural Network model and a Random Forest model to compare which method has the greatest accuracy.
## Dashboard
Tableau will be used to create the dashboard to display our findings.
