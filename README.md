# Machine Learning Diabetes

## Selected Topic

Diabetes is a leading cause of disability and mortality in the US. One of the ways healthcare providers monitor blood sugar levels in patients is by taking a blood test to measure HbA1c percentage. HbA1c is a measure of glycated haemoglobin, or glucose (sugar), that is in the red blood cells of the body. Red blood cells have a 2-3 month life span, meaning that HbA1c is an indicator of blood glucose levels over 2-3 months. High HbA1c levels mean that the patient has had 2-3 months of high levels of blood sugar, which is correlated with higher instances of diabetic complications. Using data from over 70,000 hospitalized diabetic patients nationwide, we are utilizing classification methods to predict whether HbA1c levels are within a normal range, or an abnormal (high) range, based on other health-related factors.

## Reason for topic selection

According to the CDC, 37.3 million people have diabetes (11.3% of the US population), and diabetes prevalence has grown significantly from 2004 to 2019.  We were able to locate a dataset with sufficient amounts of mostly numeric data to utilize machine learning model to answer our question.

## Description of datasource

We used data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset spans diabetic hospital encounters nationwide between 1999 and 2008 (the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00296/)).

## Question we hope to answer

Using a machine learning classification model, can demographics, diagnoses, medications, and other related indicators be used to predict whether someone admitted to the hospital with diabetes will have a normal or abnormal (high) HbA1c level?  An accurate HbA1c prediction can reduce the number of times a diabetic patient would need to obtain diagnostic blood work. 

## Technologies used:
### Hosting platform
```GitHub``` was the code hosting platform.
### Data Preprocessing and Analysis
```Pandas``` was used to explore, clean, and perform an analysis. 
### Database
```SQLAlchemy``` and ```SQLite``` were used for our database in our analysis.
### Machine Learning
```SciKitLearn``` and ```TensorFlow``` were the ML libraries we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is using an 70/30 train-test split ratio. The training set will then be fit into a Neural Network model and a Random Forest model to compare which method has the greatest accuracy.

## Dashboard
```Tableau``` was used to create the dashboard to display our findings. 
- [Raw Data Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/intisar3500/viz/UCIDiabetesRawData/UCIDiabetesRawData).
- [Database Data Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/DiabetesDBData/DiabetesDatabaseVisualization?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
Information here can be filtered relavent to potential screening questions.

**Description of Tools to create final dashboard**
- Dashboard contains multiple tabs to show different visualizations including bar charts, density charts, pie charts, etc. related to  race, age, gender, as well as other items such as most popular medicines, and the patient's status. The dashboard may also include the original dataset and visualizations similar to the ones based on our data set for the intent of story telling.

**Interactive Piece**
- A user may be able to select particular attributes such as focusing on gender, or even multiple like gender and age. If they select a group such as Females aged 20-30, it will update visuals to only show results for females aged 40-50. This will allow the user to check for different types of patients based on the data in our database. This will also be present in the original dataset visualizations for our story telling.

## Machine Learning Analysis
**Description of preliminary data preprocessing**
- Removed the following columns
  - Non-beneficial ID column – would not add value to analysis (patient_nbr)
  - Columns with missing values greater than 50% were converted into “NA” before being dropped because there’s not enough data to contribute to significant analysis (weight, payer_code, max_glu_serum, medical_specialty).
  - Columns with outliers are checked and dropped, because outliers can spoil the and mislead the training process resulting in longer training times, less accurate models and ultimately poorer results. 
  - Columns with only 1 value – 7 diabetic medications were noted as not given to any of the patients in our database, so keeping these columns would not provide additional insight (acetohexamide, troglitazone, examide, citoglipton, glimepiride-pioglitazone, metformin-rosiglitazone, metformin-pioglitazone)

**Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including their decision-making process**
- Target variable
  - HbA1c level (A1Cresult) was converted from 4 values (none, normal, >7, >8) to 2 values (≤ 7 or > 7)*
    - HbA1c level–normal (less than or equal to 7%)
    - HbA1c level-high (greater than 7%)
- Feature variables: 
  - utilized Random Forest Model to rank feature importance in order and selected the top 8 features:
    - num_lab_procedures
    - num_medications	
    - time_in_hospital	
    - num_procedures	
    - number_diagnoses	
    - discharge_disposition_id	
    - admission_type_id	
    - admission_source_id

**Description of how data was split into training and testing sets**
- Training set at 70%, testing set at 30%

**Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits**
- Classification model utilizing neural network and random forest models (supervised machine learning) for comparison
  - Neural Network Model: 3 hidden layers, activation function–relu (input), sigmoid (output)
    - Benefits: with a complex dataset with almost 50 feature variables, this model has a greater tolerance for messy data and detect complex, nonlinear relationships
    - Limitations: prone to overfitting and may not generalize well

**Description of how model is trained thus far, and any additional training that will take place**
- Generated Random Forest model to rank feature importance
- Utilized neural network model for classification

**Description of accuracy score**
- The accuracy score of the model was 70%, the precision was 77%, and the recall was 73%. Unfortunately, after examining the confusion matrix, the model was good at classifying high A1c but poor at classifying normal A1c.

## Database
- SQLite and SQLAlchemy
- SQLAlchemy creates connection for Pandas DataFrame
- Table 1: admission and medication information
- Table 2: admission diagnosis – diagnosis columns (diag_1, diag_2, and diag_3) were grouped by ICD-9 codes of the major human organ systems
- The aboves tables were joined by encounter_id
